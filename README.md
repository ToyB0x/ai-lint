# ai-lint
A document linting tool by AI. This is an experimental project that I am exploring AI, so there may be better tools out there.

## TODO:
- Define rule of rules
- Add Rule

## NOTE:
Currently, AI Coding tools like cline are not available to load url in text files(but @url command can load url), so I created this AI linting tool.
