# ai-lint
A document linting tool by AI. This is an experimental project that I am exploring AI, so there may be better tools out there.

## ROADMAP:
- Provide MCP Server for cline and other tools with following features:
  - Able to load local and remote rules.
  - Able to pack and compact rules for improve performance and reduce AI's API cost (reduce API Usage).
  - Able to detect lint violations and fix linting errors.
- Provide reusable and sharable rules registry via GitHub repository with following features:
  - Version management
  - Rule management
  - Extendable rule system
  - Customizable rule system
  - Prioritize rule system
  - Meta rule system
- Provide recommended rules for common use cases with following features:
  - For user guide
  - For product development
  - For internal document

## TODO:
- Define rule of rules
- Add Rule

## NOTE:
Currently, AI Coding tools like cline are not available to load url in text files(but @url command can load url), so I created this AI linting tool.
