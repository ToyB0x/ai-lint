## Overview

AI-Lint is a comprehensive platform for controlling AI behavior through rules loaded from a Rule Registry. While traditional linters focus solely on code quality, AI-Lint extends this concept to your entire development ecosystem - from code and documentation to development workflows and LLM interactions.

**AI conforms to your standards, not the other way around.** Define rules that reflect your organization's style, structure, and requirements across all aspects of development. Whether you're creating documentation, optimizing workflows, or customizing LLM behavior, AI-Lint ensures consistency and quality throughout your development process.

### Key Features

AI-Lint transforms how teams work with AI across four key areas:

#### AI Behavior Control
- **Flexible Rule System**: Create, share, and extend rules for all aspects of development
- **Rule Registry**: Load rules from local files or remote repositories with version control
- **MCP Server Integration**: Seamless integration with AI tools

#### Documentation Excellence
- **Documentation Standards**: Define and enforce consistent documentation practices
- **Auto-Fix Capability**: Automatically fix documentation issues

#### Development Workflow Enhancement
- **Workflow Optimization**: Create rules with LLM assistance for better development workflows
- **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Involve PO/PdM/Business teams in rule creation

#### LLM Interaction Improvement
- **Behavior Customization**: Tailor AI outputs to match your organization's specific needs

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ToyB0x/ai-lint.git
cd ai-lint

# Install dependencies and build
pnpm install && pnpm build
```

Add to your MCP server configuration file (adjust the path to your installation):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "@ai-lint/mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/PATH/TO/YOUR_DIR/ai-lint/apps/mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "autoApprove": [],
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Basic Usage

1. Create a `.clinerules` file in your project root:

```
You (AI assistants like Cline or Roo Code) must follow these important rules:

- Verify that the MCP Server @ai-lint/mcp is properly set up
- If not set up correctly, inform the user "The @ai-lint/mcp configuration is incorrect" and halt all subsequent processing
- If set up correctly, execute @ai-lint/mcp's load-remote-act-rule and apply the following rules
```

2. Restart your AI assistant to ensure it recognizes the new MCP server and rules.
